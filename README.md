# Development

Requirements:

 * [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org/)

LiveReload might also need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) if you don't have support for that in your editor of choice.

## Setting up

All you need to do is clone the repository and run `npm start`.
This will install all necessary dependencies and start the server at localhost:8000.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/futurice/futurice-super.git
#...
$ npm start
```

For LiveReload via Grunt:

```bash
$ grunt
```
